## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This is just a rmd file to refresh my memory of coursework taught by Andreas Buja and Linda Zhao

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
x
```

```{r}
length(x)
y <- c(1,2,3)
length(y)
```

```{r}
x+y
```

```{r}
ls()
rm(A, Auto, cylinders, f, fa)
```

```{r}
ls()
```

Remove all objects
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```


```{r}
ls()
```

We can learn about certain functions as shown below
```{r}
?ls()
```


```{r}
x <- matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, ncol=2)
x
```


```{r}
y <- matrix(data = c(5,6,7,8),2,2)
y
```

```{r}
z <- matrix(c(12,34,56,78),2,2,byrow=TRUE)
z
```

```{r}
sqrt(z)
z^2
```

The rnorm() function generates a vector of random normal variables,
with first argument n the sample size.

By default, rnorm() creates standard normal random variables with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1
```{r}
x = rnorm(50)
y = x + rnorm(50, mean=50, sd=0.1)
cor(x, y)
```

Sometimes we want our code to reproduce the exact same set of random
numbers; we can use the set.seed() function to do this

```{r}
set.seed(1400)
rnorm(50)
```

mean() and var() functions. Note that var() is just the standard deviation squared.

```{r}
set.seed(3)
y = rnorm(100)
mean(y)
var(y)
sqrt(var(y))
sd(y)
```

Plotting stuff in R 
```{r}
x= rnorm(100)
y = rnorm(100)
plot(x,y)
```

```{r}
plot(x,y, xlab = "This is the x-axis", ylab = "This is the y-axis", main = 'X vs Y plot')
```


```{r}
pdf("Figure.pdf")
plot(x,y,col='green')
dev.off()
```

 
 
```{r}
x = seq(1,10)
x
x <- 1:20
x
x = seq(-pi, pi, length = 50)
x
```


```{r}
?contour()
```

Create  contour plot
```{r}
y = x
f = outer(x,y, function(x,y)cos(y)/(1+x^2))
contour(x,y,f)
contour(x,y,f,nlevels=45, add=T)
fa = (f-t(f))/2
contour(x,y,fa, nlevels = 15)
```

Let's make a heatmap or a color coded contour map just like in weather forecasts. The arguments theta and phi control the angles at which the plot is viewed.
```{r}
image(x,y,fa)
persp(x,y,fa)
persp(x,y,fa, theta=30)
persp(x,y,fa,theta=30, phi=20)
persp(x,y,fa,theta=30, phi=70)
persp(x,y,fa,theta=30, phi=40)

```


indexing in R
```{r}
A <- matrix(c(1:16),4,4)
A
```


The first number after the open-bracket symbol[
always refers to the row, and the second number always refers to the column
```{r}
A[2,3]
```

Selecting multiple columns and multiple rows
```{r}
A[c(1,3), c(2,4)]
```

```{r}
A[c(1:3), c(2:4)]

```



```{r}
A[1:2,]
```

```{r}
A[ ,1:2]
```

The use of a negative sign - in the index tells R to keep all rows or columns except those indicated in the index.

```{r}
A[-c(1,3),]
```

```{r}
A[1,]
```

dim() gives the number of rows followed by the number of rows in a given matrix

```{r}
dim(A)
```

Let's import the Auto Data from the proper directory. Always change the .whatever extension in the properties itself
```{r}
Auto = read.table('Auto.data')
View(Auto)
```
```{r}

```

This is the same as pwd in the linux terminal
```{r}
getwd()

```
```{r}
View(Auto)
```

Loading the data correctly: so correct it. So read the first line as a header and replace ? as na.

```{r}
Auto = read.table("Auto.data", header = T, na.strings = "?")
View(Auto)
dim(Auto)
```

use the na.omit() function to simply remove these rows
```{r}
Auto = na.omit(Auto)
dim(Auto)
names(Auto)
```


```{r}
plot(cylinders, mpg)
```


To refer to a variable, we must type the data set and the variable name
joined with a $ symbol.

```{r}
plot(Auto$cylinders, Auto$mpg)
```
```{r}
attach(Auto)
```

```{r}
plot(cylinders, mpg)
```


The cylinders variable is stored as a numeric vector, so R has treated it as quantitative. One may prefer to treat it as a qualitative variable.The function converts quantitative variables into qualitative as.factor() variables.

```{r}
cylinders = as.factor(cylinders)
```

If the variable plotted on the x-axis is categorial, then boxplots will automatically be produced by the plot() function.

```{r}
plot(cylinders, mpg)
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red" )
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T )
plot(cylinders, mpg, col = "red", varwidth = T, horizontal = T )
plot(cylinders, mpg, col  = 'red', varwidth = T, xlab = 'cylinders', ylab = 'MPG')

```

```{r}
hist(mpg)
hist(mpg, col =2)
hist(mpg, col=2, breaks=15)
```

```{r}
pairs(Auto)
pairs(~mpg + displacement + horsepower + weight + acceleration, Auto)
```


```{r}
plot(horsepower, mpg)
identify(horsepower, mpg, name)
```
```{r}
summary(Auto)
summary(Auto$mpg)
```

```{r}
q()

```
